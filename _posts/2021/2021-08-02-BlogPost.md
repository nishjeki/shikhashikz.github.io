The length and breadth does not matter. The depth matters!

My latest current read, ***Everybody Writes,*** prompted me to ask a question to myself on how many words I would like for my blog post? 

Should it be less than a hundred, few hundred or run in thousands? On deeper thought, I decided that I will not chain myself to any word limit. This rule I have for my novels. For the daily blogpost, let the learning flow, does not matter if itâ€™s in few words or runs into pages.
