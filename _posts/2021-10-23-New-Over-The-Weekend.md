Why there is a HIGHWAY to Hell, but stairway to Heaven!!! 

***Apart from Peak Community, my source of inspiration is also Sethâ€™s blog.***

>Good times, bad times, high tide, low tides, Seth always has something to share. And when I hopped to his site today, it has a [new look](https://www.sethgodin.com/) with an announcement to a new book! ðŸ“–

>I wonâ€™t spoil your surprise! If Seth is in your list of influence, check out his site NOW! BTW I am thinking of having one new shelf only with Sethâ€™s books. They are like Marketing bibles!!
