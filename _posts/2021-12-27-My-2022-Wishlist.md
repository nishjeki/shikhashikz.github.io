***Hoping that 2022 turns out as an awesome year for us Marketers.***

As we venture in the last week of 2021, my top three wish list from 2022 is:

â€¢	Sales, Marketing and Customer Success works as ONE TEAM ðŸ’¯

â€¢	Marketing has shared goals with Sales and Customer Success team ðŸ’¥

â€¢	Marketers listens to Sales calls (This is ingrained as a KRA for Marketers) ðŸŽ§

What are you wishing from 2022?
