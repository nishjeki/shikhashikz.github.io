From 2008 to 2018 ; Simple Maths, It's been ten years of association with Bentley Systems. I vividly remember the day when I had packed my 
stuff from Delhi,said good bye to ICICI Bank , with a vow to never return to Delhi's work life.I had no clue where I will stay 
but Bentley was providing me ten days of accomodation.And I was sure,I will definitely find a place to stay.
With this grit and the firing passion to swing my career, I landed in Pune.

2nd June 2008, was the day when I officially started my career with Bentley Systems.New people,new environment,new place of stay everything was so new.I had no pre conceived notions and started from scratch.I would call this as a rebirth.I can go on and on with the stories and incidentswhich have made me who I am today , but I would like to list down top ten learnings:

1)What it means to have a mentor.All through my life I had critics who were ready to pull me down and waited with bated breath to catch on my mistakes.But here I learnt and understood the meaning and the importance of a mentor. Like any other relationship , this also needs cooperation from both the ends.Both the parties need to put genuine efforts for the betterment of each other.

2)Every day is a new day.And each day brings its own set of challenges.Smile and viogour to take challenges head steers the way.

3)Information Overload need to be avoided and it might backfire your plan.

4)Never burn the bridges

5)A smile goes a long way in turning the tables

6)Think and feel from your heart when you are handling a team

7)The day your conversations steer away from people and move towards goals,visions,give a pat to yourself on the back

8)Never reject anybody only by seeing a resume.

9)Be a leader and not a manager.Do not take advantage of your position and treat others or your suborindates as lower downs.

10)You are not what your title is , first you are a human being.Be human

All these might sound philosophical and you might have heard read before, but work does not define you, your own personality define you.Be a good human and be empathetic towards people around you.Sometimes you might need to take a hard stand, to get the work done or achieve targets, but never leave touch with your inner human.Good karma concept is also applicable in work life.

I am presenting myself a gift and happy to celebrate this occasion.Hard work,honesty, enthusiasm and right attutude goes a long way.Cheers to many more.
