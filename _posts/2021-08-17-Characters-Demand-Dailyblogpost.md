Writing Trivia

>I did not come across characters in all the fables where they are discussing their existential/ spiritual needs. Itâ€™s always about either the physical needs or the longing to be with somebody who completes their life.

Have you read any book where the character is yearning to grow spiritually? Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead is one. Any other?
