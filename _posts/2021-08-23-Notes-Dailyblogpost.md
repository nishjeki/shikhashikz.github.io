The way you take notes, speaks a lot about you.

I am an avid note taker. I have kept a separate notepad to jot down the notes, important page numbers from the business books which I read. I saw one of Sangram’s video where he took us on a virtual book tour. What he does is, he jots down important page numbers and that one big takeaway on the back side of the front page or in the front pages of the books.

>Won’t it be nice if authors/ publishers kept few blank pages in the beginning and towards the end for the note takers? It will be of great help to have in the reference notes right there in, rather than maintaining in different places and then going back to the book.

How do you prefer to take your notes?
